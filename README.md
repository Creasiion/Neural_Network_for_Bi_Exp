# Neural Network for Bi Exponentials Instructions
1. Download **ALL** files provided.
2. Unzip both .zip files!
    -  Big_Sim_Generated_Data.zip already had data provided for you, so it isn't necessary to run the code (very time consuming if otherwise!)
    -  Version_47_NN.zip has our (UW Ginger Lab) best version of this neural network so far.
3. Run and read through all files in their numbered order
    - "1_Bi_Exp_Big_Sim.ipynb" **(SKIP IF Big_Sim_Generated_Data.zip) IS DOWNLOAED)**
    - "2_Resampling"
    - "3_Visualizing_New_Training_Data.ipynb"
    - "4_NN_Bi_Exp.ipynb"
    - "5_SHAP.ipynb"
